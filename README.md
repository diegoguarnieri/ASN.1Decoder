# ASN.1Decoder

# ASN.1

Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard and notation that describes rules and structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data in telecommunications and computer networking. The formal rules enable representation of objects that are independent of machine-specific encoding techniques. Formal notation makes it possible to automate the task of validating whether a specific instance of data representation abides by the specifications. In other words, software tools can be used for the validation.

Please see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) for more details.


# This project

ASN.1Decoder is able to decode files in [BER, CER and DER formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690) to ASCII. If a ASN.1 schema is present, ASN.1Decoder can join the files decoded and the fields in ASN.1 schema.


# Languages

This project is available in Java ang Go


# Installation

To install this project, you can 'git clone' and import to your prefered IDE.


# Future

Some improvements are necessary

- Full ASN.1 schema parser
- Decode files encoded in Base64 format
- Validate ASN.1 rules
